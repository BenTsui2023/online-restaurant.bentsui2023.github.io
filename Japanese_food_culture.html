                    <h2>Features of Japanese Food Culture</h2>
                    <p>
                        Influenced by Chinese cuisine and Western cuisines, Japanese cuisine is mixed with a wide variety of features from different countries from east to west. For example, you can find some Chinese cuisine features from ramen and gy≈çza, which are similar to Chinese noodle and Dumplings.
                        Also, you can find some Western cuisines features from Japanese curry rice and hamburgers.

                    <p>
                        In addition to features influenced by other countries, Japanese cuisine deems fish as a main dish. Japan is an island and surrounded by water so that fish is a main source of protein for Japanese people. Therefore, there are many fresh dishes such as sushi and Sashimi.

                        Besides,Japanese cuisine tends to preserve the original favour of the ingredients. Also, they usually use less salt and cooking oil.

                    <h2>The Culture of Sushi</h2>
                    <p>
                        Sushi may be the most famous Japanese foods around the world. There are some culture you should know when you eat sushi.
                        First, we should not dip the sushi rice in soy sauce because it will destroy the sticky texture of the sushi rice. Instead, we should dip the fish part to the soy sauce.<br>
                        Second, We should use minimal amount of wasabi because most of the cheif often prepare rolls with wasabi within the sushi.<br>
                        Finally, we may eat ginger between different types of sushi to refresh our palate.
