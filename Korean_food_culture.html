                    <h2>Features of Korean Food Culture</h2>
                    <p>
                        Rice, vegetables, seafood and meats are the main ingredients of Korean cuisine. Like Chinese cuisine, Korean cuisine seldom uae dairy. Also, they eat fermented foods such as kimchi, doenjang and ganjangas as side dishes called banchan every meal.<br>
                        As most of the banchan is made with fermentation for flavor and preservation, many side dishes are salty, and spicy in taste and this is one of the reason why Korean food is well known for being spicy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Besides, Korean believes that <q>food and medicine are grown from the same root</q>. They eat medicinal food which includes ginseng, chicken and beef bone soups etc. regularly to restore physical stamina.
